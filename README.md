# NY Citibike with Tableau

## Overview of the Analysis
This project was to create a presentation for potential investors who might be interested in helping start a bikesharing business in Des Moines, Iowa. Bikeshare rider data from New York City's "NY Citibike" platform was used to model a proposal for how a similar buisness could be successful in Des Moines. We used a NY Citibike data set from August 2019 to conduct the analysis for the presentation. The following bike trip analyses were included in the business plan:
- The number of bike trips for all riders (customers vs. subscribers) and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders (customers vs. subscribers) and genders.
- The number of bike trips for each type of user (customer vs. subscribers) and gender for each day of the week.
- The most popular starting and ending points for all bike trips in the city.
